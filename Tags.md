# Tags

## Legend

`[]` denotes a tag. Any tag can be nested into others.

`.` can be used to enhance the tag name.

## Catalog

- `temporary`
- `duplicate_code`
- `workaround`
    - `inaccessible_access` *Involves accessing something not intended by the provider. E.g., accessing a private member via template code in c++. This is scary because anything private is fair game to be changed by the providers, without notice and without even deprecated support.*

## Examples

```
[duplicate_code[engine]]
```

```
[workaround.inaccessible_access[engine]]
```
